# 06. Mapping & GIS

2024.12.05

## Agenda
1. Updates and announcements:
  -  Illizt: She has been working on growing her photogrammetry skills by doing a session with Marianne Weldon in Special Collections. She's done multiple photography circuits on the object, but has been unable to process them via the Agisoft software. She's also tried scanning 3D scanning.
   -  Yuzhu: She has been learning to use Blender and has followed an online tutorial to create a basic donut model. She encountered some issues, primarily due to system differences between her Mac and the tutorial's Windows-based instructions. She plans to readjust her SMART goal accordingly.
   - Hilde: She has updated her SMART goal and resolved the issue with the manifest, which involved differences between types of manifest and APIs. She successfully addressed the file uploading issue by uploading film clips to the Internet Archive and transferring or linking them to IIIF files. The elements she is working with have become clearer, and she plans to post an update next week while practicing different skills. Alice has offered assistance with troubleshooting.
2. Instruction topic
   
   ###### GIS Introduction
   - There is a list of available resources, including tools, tutorials, and documentation, in the "resources" folder on GitHub. 
   - The primary goal of the meeting was to create an interactive map for the web, demonstrating the potential of mapping tools in various digital projects. One of the key features of these tools is their ability to perform geo-spatial analysis, making them versatile for tasks like visualizing data or creating digital exhibitions that incorporate maps.
   - A variety of tools are available, and the choice of software depends largely on the specific requirements of a project. QGIS is recommended as a reliable option, while ArcGIS is not compatible with macOS.
  
   ###### Workshop
   - Tessa led our GIS workshop. She showed us her own GIS project on bicycle crashes in Philadelphia. She obtained the data from OpenDataPhilly and used various colors and symbols to display information. The visualization included interactive features, such as pop-ups that appear when hovering over designated points to provide additional details. This visualization supported her cluster analysis for her thesis.
   - She introduced Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library that can be used within a website to create and publish maps. While it is an accessible tool for publishing interactive maps, it has a steep learning curve, requiring at least a basic understanding of JavaScript (though not complete mastery). Tessa also noted that while there are other ways to publish maps, many of these methods are not free.
   - During the workshop, we practiced creating a small project using QGIS. The project involved mapping airports around the world, where we used tools to mark airports with dots of different sizes (small, medium, large) and colors. We also added features that allowed selective information to appear as pop-ups when interacting with the map.
