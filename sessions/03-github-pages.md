## Agenda
1. Updates and announcements
2. Instruction topic
3. Other

## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Illizt

# Illizt got super late 

We started talking a about our SMART goals and it looks good, according to Alice. 

## Yuzhu
Yuzhu started and had two goals. People are identifying primary goals and secondary goals. For Yuzhu is working on blender, scanning together.  

## Illizt 
My project was one thing, then I realized I wanted to add something else like merging a 3D model with an image of mirrors. Although Illustrator seems hard, there are certain thing I can that are enough to trace the image; it is not scary as it sounds. We can learn Illustrator on Fridays at 1pm.  

## Lala 

Arch map online is a good start to get the data for her project. There is a hard realization of not recognizing a program that we already knew, and when things have changed after some years. She has a jump start, however, and is making progress in refamiliarizing with the new technology. Alice asked to upload her updates by summarizing her bigger proposal. It is fine to have a very polished thorough proposal, but for the Digital Scholarship it is to be summarized.  

## Logistics about rescheduling 

- We are switching 3d scanning on the 7th November for GIS the 5th of December.  

## General announcements 

-Before the meeting, Wednesday morning preferably, we are to add our updates. 

## Syllabus 

#Experimental blending of Github and Html 

- How to add site to Github, minimal computing 

# GitHub Pages 

- Github Pages is free web hosting while we are enrolled at Bryn Mawr, but after graduating, we have to pay it on our on own and it is expensive.  
- Side note: computational cost is insane compared to regular search.  
- It takes takes Git Hub to turn into HTML: version control tool, code. It helps in saving different versions of something as a more intentional process and does it more carefully. Saves your collaboration history, branching also. For code, every version is saved.  
- Good for preserving change history, label changes. It is great for collaboration. This is good for memory. 
- GitHub is an open source software for collaboration workflow. This is the biggest one. Git is free. 

## Markdown: Mark up language, different from html 

- In markdown the little tags are not here.  
- Labelling things according to hierarchies, different format in HTML.  
- Here the syntax is not annoying, but not completely text.  

## Create a GitHub repository 
- It is like a folder or project; the unit by which things are organized. 
- You can share that with other people. For collaborations this has its own coherence. 
- There is no bigger folder that contains the repository, which is good for code because a piece of code could have dependencies in folders, so it has interrelated connections. It basically helps the code.  
- Add in plus>give name (part of url, kind of like a file name; a common practice is the use of lower cases with dashes between the name) 
- You can change the repository name 
- For pages it should be public 
- Recommendations: 
    -add read me 
- git ignore, put files that you do not file that organizes folders, not important to content of folder, you do not have to share with other people 
- license is a good thing to add – depending on the kinds of used things, code also could have restrictions. The repository is intellectual property, things that you do not want to be used. You can protect rights. It could apply to code and other stuff.  
- Once you have made your choices create the repository, and then you can add collaborators, give access, share things 

# Licenses 
- Creative commons has a lot of licenses not for commercial purposes and does the intellectual process. They basically have done all the work. Or, if you do it on your own you are putting a lot of work on you.  
- There are other resources that have licenses. 

# Git 
- Settings, collaborators, add person 
- Read me file 
- Most repositories have it. Give an overview of what this project is: what it does and who you are 
- The repository creators develop those 
- Commit – a package set of changes that are labelled. You can add the name for the changes to know what you did. You can describe why you did it. The message provides that information.
  
# Publish 
- settings > pages>  
- select Deploy from a branch
- In the branch you choose where to put the folder 
- About> use git hub pages>saves changes 

# What happens 
- static site vs. Dynamiic site. A static file is one can access in the web. As opposed to other things, which are generated every time.  
- Dynamic or static looks the same, but it is faster if it is static. This is so because no software is used to generate, and it is easier to maintain. There is no need for upgrades and no need to pay more attention to it.  
- A dynamic site can you tell us where you are; it will change according to that information and is adapted. A VPN would tie into that 
- Software runs every time you navigate 
- A static site runs the software only once whenever you update it. 
- SSG – static site generator 
- Plugs content into html content 
- it is much better than doing html 
- Html – programming language 
- CSS makes it pretty; it is the style for it tells how to express.  

# Dynamic sites 
- They are great if you do not have coding skills 
- when collaborating with people 

# GitHub 
- Learning a little HTML would help in the working world 

# Markup 
- Language of html
  
# Markdown  
- Different from the others 
-Knowing html Markup helps in customizing style.  

# YAML 
- different to Markup Languages 
- gives metadata about page described 
- different to HTML in which it is displayed by labels 
- provides info that is not in the Markdown 

# How to change things in GitHub pages 
- Static: main page is named index.html: that is a / at the end, there is an index.html in a folder with x name 
- It takes a while for the changes to appear 

# Create file 
- underscore, utility and info 

# Add a theme 
- style, Java or CSS, images, etc 
- there are many themes 
- jekyll theme is very modular, will go into the theme, grabs everything in order to use the site.  
- layout html wrapper that the content goes into, metadata values, yaml, markdown.
