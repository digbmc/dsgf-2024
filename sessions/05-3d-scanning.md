## Updates
Hilde
There was an error with the uploading of the video currently in use but will find some time later to focus on the troubleshoot. 
-Among the things she is doing, apart from the annotation part, she is playing with other functions like adding layers, tags, transcriptions, analysis and how it is useful for those functions. She will be adjusting her SMART goal, and will continue to play around to add static images to do frame analysis. She is still learning about what is wrong with the manifest. Alice advised to use it with a functional manifest and suggested a meeting to have a look at that together. Playing with Scaler, which works for content management system, might help because it has a built-in functionality for image annotations and time-based annotations; it is more user friendly and is more flexible.  

Yuzhu
She continued learning blender and has finished the 5 hours tutorial.
-She noticed that Blender is good at manipulating light and creating animations. However, that the latter is not her main purpose. The use of light is good for her thesis which focuses on using color to reflect light and dark contrast in the murals at the Chinese Buddhist site she is studying. 
-She is thinking about using another tool with Blender to envision space, perhaps Alice Vision which is an open source. She will do more research about processing and using both. 
Jeff’s advice: Agisoft would be the best in photogrammetry reconstruction. However, training is required for that. Agisoft is at the digital lab and can be used with pictures done outside Bryn Mawr or from the Special Collections. 
-She could use the model that already exists in order to do other things with that to create 3D scenarios. She will send the website and send them to Alice and Jeff. TO practice. 

Illizt
-She continued experimenting with printing the drawings of mirrors in acrylic.
-Additionally, she developed a 3D digital model using the 3D scanner at the Special Collections and printed it in 3D with PLA plastic. 
-Started reviewing the information available on Photogrammetry.

## BRIEF OVERVIEW
-technologies, available on campus.
-demo scans

## History and uses
-1960’s – lasers, technology available that shoots a beam of light at stuff. It was used for different things, like astronomy.
1980’s -The previous technology was used in scanning, military land survey, and mining to calculate areas. There was a realization that using the beam and velocity could help in creating 3D models with the basic function of shooting light at an object, receiving the information that returns and doing something else with that information. 
1990’s – There were major improvements like the handheld scanners.
2000’s-The same technology was applied to other fields like videogames, movies, TV, civil engineering, or in medicine for orthopedics to fit better, and, of course, cultural heritage!!!!! It is important to state that building the skill of 3D modelling is something that you can use, a transferable skill to other fields, or at least something that help us understand the world differently. 

## 3D scanning techniques available on campus
1.	Turn table scanner – It moves the piece all around and gives you the 3D model. It automatically scales to manipulate it in many ways like for 3D printing. It does the tricky part for you like figuring distance, but it does not solve anything. It is great for feeling confident for distance and overview, but you still have to do arrangements. It helps a lot in producing a model of cultural heritage without damaging it. 
2.	Handheld scanner – It collects data capturing extra details. By holding the handheld scanner and going around the object, the scanner collects details, surfaces, and information on color. It is harder than the turn table because you are responsible for the distance, and crevices are always a problem. There is no guarantee that you are getting every single detail. The distance has to be learned and cultivated by discipline and patience. It is worthy because you can get more detailed information with this tool. One downside is that a lot of data is used for this, so you have to own a good computer. 
3.	Photogrammetry
This is the most difficult process for creating 3D models. It generally uses a camera but sometimes also a handheld scanner. With camera pictures a 3D model is built. There is an in between step before the meshing to process the image. 
*We watched Pirco-One photogrammetry from Chicago. 
You need to have a good camera and move slowly taking pictures of the same space to capture a lot of details. 
*Drones –work for spaces that are lit, for caves and so it would be different. 
*There is a 3D scanning spray that can help you with the scanning; it does not distort light, but it cannot be used in cultural heritage.

## DEMO
*Important: the scanner should be connected to the computer before opening the software because then the scanner is recognized by the software. 

First time tutorial
1.	Connect the device first because if not the software will not detect it.
2.	Use the dotted plate to calibrate. Place it on the stand on the center of the turn table. The software will walk you through the process.
-Calibrate for the scanner to understand light and how much is coming in and out. 
-There is a calibration weight pre-prepared. The software will give instructions. 
-The scanner captures the four dots for certain angles, but the back is not relevant. It gives sense of where things stand. 
-Turn the plaque 3 times counterclockwise.
-Then use the backside, but, again, the software walks you through calibration. 
-Things are ready when the software says the calibration is successful. Put the calibration back on the box inside its felt bag once used because it is fragile.
3.	Make a model of a tardigrade: microscopic animal; lots of them everywhere, can remain dehydrated for a long time. Brownen made the wooden versions. They are in the second Ant-man movie. 
Options:
*Texture scan – captures paint, texture and stuff; anything that is 2D 
*Non-texture – better because the texture is difficult. 
4.	The table stays on forever even if you are only scanning one side. 
5.	Turn the brightness up. The red color tells you where you are getting your reflection, but beware of not overexposing. It is a little bit of trial and error. You can modify the settings of the brightness during the process if you notice things are not being captured. 
6.	Choose align mode. Turntable alignment is fine, but you can also play with this.
7.	Choose your Turn table steps: you can also play with those. 
8.	Choose Speed: we used 4 to see what happens. 
9.	Click the play button once you have your choice of settings, and it will start scanning. As it goes over the process, you can see the image coming through as data is added. The model can be seen in two different colors:
*Blue for exterior, and the other color for the flip side that is constructed. 
10.	You can turn the digital model with the mouse. Once it is finished with the steps, you click on the checkmark.
11.	A work menu will appear and you can play with it to see the different layers, choose to see some or not, hide them, or erase what does not work for you. 
12.	Look at the missed data and then tip the object on its sides to get the missing data and scan again.
13.	Sometimes you might get data you do not need, so you can use shift+left mouse key, wrap something, and outright delete it. You can correct data that way. 
14.	Remember to always click on the check mark. 
15.	The software combines the scans together. The square, which is the global optimization, can help a lot with the combination. 
16.	To get the extra data: You can do a half pass, but you can manipulate the standing of the object, propping the object at different angles. You can do half turns or full turns. You can always pause the scan and run it again. When propping, remember to make it as steady as possible because the machine is going to assume that the object is static. If it moves, it will move the information in the digital model. 
17.	Manipulate speed, turns, brightness in order to get as much data as possible. 
-With slower speed you get more detail, but with a speedy scan you get less, maybe you need that in order to have a model right away that does not need detail. It depends on the object that you are using to do the scanning, and so the prop should help to get to those little details. Use the delete key to delete what you have selected. End the command using the space key. 
18.	Remember to always do the global optimization. 
19.	Navigate the scans to see the ones that work and the ones that do not, and delete whatever you do not need. 
20.	If you accidentally open the editing window you can just click the check mark and return to the model. 
21.	If there is a gap, and you do not have time or do not need detail, you can mesh.
22.	Meshing – It is based on the sequence adding dots in order to fill in the blank space. 
*Watertype model – shape with no holes in it
*Unwater – fills spaces in triangulation; with less data it does not fill anything. 
-Flat surfaces are easier to fill, but round ones are difficult. Sometimes the fill is good sometimes it is not. If you want precision, the mesh helps filling really small holes missing.
You can smooth certain things if it helps. And there are other ways to manipulate the model once you have done the mesh. 
What to do later with the scan. 
With a 3D model 
1.	3D printing – produce a tangible object. Export in .obj or .stl file type. at the Makerspace. 
2.	There is more to do in Cura to prepare something for printing. You have to establish some settings. 
3.	It takes a long time to 3D print. You can leave it working at the Makerspace. 
4.	Printers are not perfect. You can have it printing, and the machine could mess the job. Plan your printing ahead for a class or event.
5.	Show in a digital repository. MorphoSource from Duke university. All manner of objects that people can look at. Cool stuff, dinosaurs is a big part of the collection, but you can find many things. You can download and manipulate use. There are different selections in the viewing. 
*Volumetric view – cloud of dots that represent the interior space as well. It measures density and it uses a different process.  
*Mesh-You can see the model with surface features
- You might get access for educational purposes. 
6.	Sketchfab is a repository to offer downloadable models for free, but now they are migrating everything called Fab to be monetized. Bryn Mawr, then, will look for another source. Sketchfab has a nice feature for hosting in a website. We do not know about MorphoSource. We could help in the migration to MorphoSource if we are interested. 
7.	You can book a time to print a 3D model that you find on line, and there is a form online to book at the Makerspace.
