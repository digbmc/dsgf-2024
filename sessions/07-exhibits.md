### Digital Exhibits

- Slides: [Digital Exhibits](https://brynmawr-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/amcgrath1_brynmawr_edu/EaklqJJapcNPhgpTP4VrA6ABApiZe4xam6xnvpmjZL12kA?e=LH5Hm0)
  - Digital exhibitions as digital collections, narratives, or criticisms that utilize media objects and/or resources
    - E.g., the Colored Conventions Project and its use of Omeka to manage the data
    - Digital exhibitions usually allow you to display the media in a viewer and see its metadata. They also often support interactive features (including timelines, maps, annotations, visualizations, etc.)
    - Platforms include Omeka, CollectionBuilder, Scalar, WordPress, and Exhibit.so. Static site builders include Jekyll and Wax, and other narrative tools include Juncture, ESRI StoryMaps, StoryMap JS, and Timeline JS. 
      - Some of these platforms, including Exhibit.so, require IIIF images (IIIF = International Image Interoperability Framework). IIIF images allow you to track metadata, obtain high-res resolutions, add annotations, etc. utilizing manifests. 
- Exhibit.so activity
