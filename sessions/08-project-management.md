### Business
- Updates & announcements
  - Illizt: Currently working on perfecting photogrammetry mesh of the mirror she's used for pervious 3D scans. The most recent scan can be found [here](https://brynmawr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/icastillop_brynmawr_edu/EZlC2_lES_VJjy2aFZbS7qgBsIV1wBJV0RfL5hpBc2cykA?e=ZIujGp). It's both missing data she wants and containg data she doesn't want, so she's going to keep working on perfecting the model.
  - Hilde: Is facing an issue with the tool she was planning to use for annotation no longer being functional. She will work with Alice on finding a new one.
  - Yuzhu: Has continued working in Blender. She's debating whether or not to use content within her presentation that generated that's generated by an AI-modeling tool, [Rodin](https://hyper3d.ai/). Long story short, she should can use the tool but should make sure it's from a reputable proivder and that any models that she generates don't have licensing issues. 
- Other business
