### Business
- Updates & announcements
  -Illizt: Currently working on perfecting photogrammetry mesh of the mirror she's used for pervious 3D scans. The most recent scan can be found here. It's both missing data she wants and containg data she doesn't want, so she's going to keep working on perfecting the model.
  -Hilde: Is facing an issue with the tool she was planning to use for annotation no longer being functional. She will work with Alice on finding a new one.
  -Yuzhu: Has continued working in Blender. She's debating whether or not to use content within her presentation that generated that's generated by an AI-modeling tool, Rodin(https://hyper3d.ai/). Long story short, she should can use the tool but should make sure it's from a reputable proivder and that any models that she generates don't have licensing issues.
