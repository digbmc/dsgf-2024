2. Discussion: How Computers Work
3. [Introduction to the Command Line Workshop](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/)

## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Hilde

### Updates & SMART Goals

#### Illizt: producing 3D models of five mirror objects in Bryn Mawr Special Collections using photogrammetry and handheld/turntable 3D scanner
  - creating models of spaces in SketchUp to place modeled objects in situ
  - using 3D models, hoping to try to restitute the original color of the bronze
  - has already begun initial steps of securing permissions and researching objects

#### Yuzhu: learn a 3D modeling tool (e.g., Blender, Unity)
  - would like to produce an interactive 3D model of section of cave temple
  - potential issues: most available images fragmented and incomplete, wouldn’t be able to take photos on site

#### Lala: learn a mapping software (e.g., GIS) and produce map of the underworld
  - hoping to tie SMART goal to prelim exams; meeting with advisor to finalize next steps
  - would like to include data visualization/story map
  - would ideally like final project to be web-based

#### Hilde: produce AudiAnnotate project with interpretive annotations
  - one of the steps would be to learn to produce IIIF AV materials
  - will likely produce something no longer than 5 minutes
  - will consult the Internet Archive to see what is available

Alice has added resources re: project charter to the GitHub

### Command Line Workshop

- learning the command line key to working with many research-based programs
- worked through the command line workshop on Computational Thinking page
- Lala flagged that the tutorial for Git bash is using older versions of the software, the Atom text editor link outdated

### How Computers Work

### Command line

#### Command line resources

- [Introduction to the Command Line Workshop](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/), Tri-Co DSRI adapted from DHRI @ CUNY.
- [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash), Ian Milligan and James Baker, The Programming Historian
- Software Carpentry's [tutorial on the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (for more advanced tutorials, see the “Loops” and “Shell Scripts” sections)
- [Terminus command line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) (a fantasy choose-your-own adventure like game) (good for getting use to navigating file structures--uses only a few commands)

## Action items

- [ ] Command line follow-up
  - [ ] Finish going through the [Command Line Tutorial](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/) & post any questions to Slack
  - [ ] Optional: look at the other command line resources
- [ ] Logs
  - [ ] Create your log document: see [instructions on the sample log](../logs/sample.md)
  - [ ] Write up your SMART Goal(s) and add them to your log document
  - [ ] Add a progress update to your log by Wednesday morning before our next session
- [ ] General Reminders
  - [ ] Set up a meeting with Alice or Jeff via [Zoom Scheduler](https://scheduler.zoom.us/digital-scholarship/dsgf-consultation-meeting) if you want help with learning plans & goals.
