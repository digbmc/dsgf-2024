### 2024.09.20

-  What I've accomplished since our last meeting:
  
    - Had a meeting with Bronwen at the Makerspace to learn about the 3D modelling equipment.
          - I asked many questions and I believe I might be adding learning Illustrator to work more on the manipulation of mirror images.
    - Reached out to Matt Jameson just to meet sometime to chat about his 3D modelling experience at the Special Collections. Maybe he can advise.
          - Although we are in contact, we have yet to set an appointment later this week.
    - Reached out to Prof. Jie Shi to talk about his mirror project. We have yet to set a meeting, probably next week.
    - Created my Autodesk account
    - Reached out to Prof. Hagan about UPenn 3D modelling projects. Field trip tomorrow to talk with a person that has knowledge of that.
    - Practiced Command Line

## SMART Goal(s)

### Goal

My SMART goal is to develop 3D models of two Etruscan mirrors from the Special Collections at Bryn Mawr to use the final result for creating 3D scenarios, play with the images, conduct digital experiments with it, and potentially create clean originally shiny models digitally. 
- I will use at least 3 hours a week to research about 3D modelling options, completing tutorials, and experimenting with the 3D modelling equipment from the Maker Space.

### Action plan

- [ ] Experiment with at least two 3D modelling techniques - October 28 
- [ ] Develop one complete 3D model of a mirror - November 15
- [ ] Master Photogrammetry - December 15
- [ ] Complete the 3D models of 2 mirrors - January
