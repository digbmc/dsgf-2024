## Updates

### 2024.10.01
- Completed since last meeting:
  
    - practiced Markdown
    - refamiliarized with GitHub
    - completed command line workshop
    - took a first pass reading through the AudiAnnotate instructions

### 2024.10.24
-Unfortunately, I discovered that the entire Internet Archive is down. That being said, I was able to find a list of films in the public domain, and I think I would like to annotate short snippets from the 1962 film _Carnival of Souls_(dir. Herk Harvey)
-I was able to find a full-length version of the film on YouTube, which I believe is supported by AudiAnnotate. I will test this soon to make sure. 

-In terms of workshop related material, I worked on the GitHub Pages tutorial. I didn't do as much work with customizing the site as I would have liked, but I hope to do more after this week's review of HTML and CSS.__


## SMART Goal

My SMART goal for this program is to create a project through AudiAnnotate. I plan to annotate a short (<5 minute) video, providing a transcript and my own interpretive annotations.


### Action plan

- [X] Select video from Internet Archive or other open-source video database - October 24, 2024
- [ ] Create GitHub repository for project through AudiAnnotate and upload video link - November 7, 2024
- [ ] Complete annotation document and add to GitHub repository - December 5, 2024
- [ ] Customize the project landing page (optional) - January 2025
