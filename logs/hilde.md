## Updates

### 2024.10.01
- Completed since last meeting:
  
    - practiced Markdown
    - refamiliarized with GitHub
    - completed command line workshop
    - took a first pass reading through the AudiAnnotate instructions

### 2024.10.24
- Unfortunately, I discovered that the entire Internet Archive is down. That being said, I was able to find a list of films in the public domain, and I think I would like to annotate short snippets from the 1962 film _Carnival of Souls_ (dir. Herk Harvey). I was able to find a full-length version of the film on YouTube, which I believe is supported by AudiAnnotate. I will test this soon to make sure. 

- Housekeeping:

    - In terms of workshop related material, I worked on the GitHub Pages tutorial. I didn't do as much work with customizing the site as I would have liked, but I hope to do more after this week's review of HTML and CSS.
    - I signed up for a Domain of One's Own page.
    - I watched the "How the Internet Works" videos.
 
### 2024.11.07
- I uploaded the link to Carnival of Souls as hosted on YouTube and created a new IIIF manifest for the video (the AudiAnnotate program creates this).
    - I think I need some help troubleshooting, because GitHub Pages is giving me a notification that my manifest was unable to load, and I want to double-check my work before I try creating a file on my desktop. 
- I started working on my annotations, but I think I'm going to need to map out how the layers will work given the way that the platform produces annotations. By that, I mean that I need to decide if I divide up visual shot analysis and sonic analysis (the soundscape is crucial to the scenes I'd like to work on), if I separate out interpretive annotations, etc.
- To extend the point above, I think I'm going to want to budget more time for customizing the site and adding further pages (as in, how can I think about the appearance of the site as aesthetically aligned with the thematic goals of the site? Do I want the interpretive analysis to live as a separate essay? Is there an opportunity to bring in screenshots of individual frames, especially if they can be IIIF images themselves?)

### 2024.12.05
-I will be frank and say that I haven't had much time to focus on this project recently, but I plan to carve out some hours this next week to work on it in earnest.
-I did double check the AudiAnnotate tutorial, and I think I might have figured out what the problem with my manifest is. The instructions say that the URL should be a direct link to the audiovisual material, since it's intended for material from institutions, and I think the YouTube link, as a result, isn't compatible. 
-As a solution, I am going to try and screenrecord short clips (which is what I was going to focus on anyway, two short clips of about 3-5 minutes) and turn them into direct links using the Internet Archive, which is back up. I'm a little unsure about relying on the Internet Archive at this point, given its ongoing legal woes, but I suppose this way, I'll always have the .mov file on my computer as a back-up. 
-Because I'm now a little behind my original SMART goal, I'll plan on posting an update once I've successfully gotten the manifest to generate and started adding annotations.


## SMART Goal

My SMART goal for this program is to create a project through AudiAnnotate. I plan to annotate a short (<5 minute) video, providing a transcript and my own interpretive annotations.


### Action plan

- [X] Select video from Internet Archive or other open-source video database - October 24, 2024
- [X] Create GitHub repository for project through AudiAnnotate and upload video link - November 7, 2024
- [ ] Complete annotation document and add to GitHub repository - December 13, 2024
- [ ] Customize the project landing page - January 2025
- [ ] Add additional pages for interpretive essays - February 2025
- [ ] Add IIIF images of frames from film - February 2025
