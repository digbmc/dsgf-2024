## Updates

### 2024.10.02 

- Finished the Command Line tutorials.
- Met with Marianne Weldon at Special Collections and had a brief discussion about potential objects for 3D scanning and modeling.
- Explored Blenderâ€™s website. Found a nice tutorial for Blender, and learned some basic features that could be useful for the project.
- Downloaded and installed Blender.

## SMART Goals

### Goal

Create an interactive 3D model of a Chinese ritual bronze object from the Special Collections. 
Following that, (re)create a simple virtual space for the object using Blender, reflecting its potential assembly and placement in a funerary context. 
For now, this will be a simplified, idealized cube diorama for practice.

### Action plan

- [ ] October 24: Finish watching a 4-hour beginner tutorial for Blender. 
Review the Chinese ritual bronzes in the Special Collections and follow up with Prof. Jie Shi and Marianne for guidance and resources. 
Draft the features that will be included in the project.

- [ ] November 21: Learn all relevant features in Blender using online sources and by consulting Alice, Jeff, and peers. 
Select one object from the Special Collections to focus on. 
Sketch the possible placement of the object.

- [ ] January 23: Complete scanning the selected object and decide how to incorporate it into a virtual space.

- [ ] February 27: Place the object within the designed virtual space using the model created in Blender.
