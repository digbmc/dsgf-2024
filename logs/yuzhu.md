## Updates

### 2025.2.19
- Completed the Blender Guru Donut Tutorial (14 videos).
- Created a plate of donuts with a full setting, including the background and lighting.
- Rendered still images and an animation of the set.
- Exploring the possibility of integrating AI modeling to streamline the process. Tested Rodin (Gen 1.5) for AI-generated base models—results were promising.
- Tentative plan: I am considering rendering a decorated sarcophagus I previously researched. This would serve as a demonstration of AI-assisted 3D modeling for art historical use.
- Updated the action plan.

### 2024.12.05
- Continue learning Blender using the Youtube tutorial: currently at the beginning of Part 5 (Shading)
- Made a basic donut in Blender

### 2024.11.07
- Keep learning Blender: watched the Blender tutorial (1.5/5hrs)
- Learn about the 3D reconstruction software called Alicevision. Found a GitHub repository for the project.
- Browsed the Bryn Mawr special collection, and narrowed down the potential scanning objects to three (one Buddha statue, a bronze vessel, and a bear figurine)
- Updated the action plan.

### 2024.10.23
- Finished the github workshop.
- Downloaded github desktop, and cloned repositories to local, and started editing locally in VScode.
- Watched 8 videos in How the Internet Works series.
- Signed up for a domain (https://yuzhuwang.digital.brynmawr.edu/).
- Watched Blender tutorial (30min/5hrs).
- Practiced Blender controls and camera.

### 2024.10.02 

- Finished the Command Line tutorials.
- Met with Marianne Weldon at Special Collections and had a brief discussion about potential objects for 3D scanning and modeling.
- Explored Blender’s website. Found a nice tutorial for Blender, and learned some basic features that could be useful for the project.
- Downloaded and installed Blender.

## SMART Goals

### Goal

Create an interactive 3D model of a Chinese ritual bronze object from the Special Collections. 
Following that, (re)create a simple virtual space for the object using Blender, reflecting its potential assembly and placement in a funerary context. 
For now, this will be a simplified, idealized cube diorama for practice.

### Action plan

- [ ] October 24: Finish watching a 4-hour beginner tutorial for Blender. 
Review the Chinese ritual bronzes in the Special Collections and follow up with Prof. Jie Shi and Marianne for guidance and resources. 
Draft the features that will be included in the project.

- [ ] November 21: Learn all relevant features in Blender using online sources and by consulting Alice, Jeff, and peers.
Select one object from the Special Collections to focus on. 
Do some more research about 3D reconstruction software and how to incorporate it together with Blender in my project.
If decide to proceed with Alicevision, set up the project.

- [ ] February 28: Generate an initial 3D model of the proposed sarcophagus using AI-assisted modeling. Import the model into Blender and begin refining its structure.

- [ ] March 15: Complete the refinement phase, ensuring the model’s proportions and form are accurate. Add key incised decorations and other necessary details.

- [ ] March 31: Finalize the model with lighting adjustments and render both still images and animations. Document the entire process with notes and reflections for the showcase and future reference.
